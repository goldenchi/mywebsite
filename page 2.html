    <td>a1 A war scythe or military scythe is a form of pole weapon with a curving 
	single-edged blade with the cutting edge on the concave side of the blade.
	
	They were used as weapons, as some books show them being used. They were effective in skilled hands. 
	The blades position is difficult to predict and they can be used to make people fall. as weapons in combat. 
	... As for the advantages, the form of the weapon gives you a pretty good grip for slashing,
	and the perpendicular blade is good for hooking (much like and axe or halberd would be used),
	which is useful when facing people with shields.</td>
	
	
	
    <td>d1 Problem is, the blades position is also difficult to predict for the wielder,
	so it is easy to hurt yourself or your allies. It is no good weapon in a tight 
	formation, since it needs space to be wielded properly. for a scythe</td>

  <tr>
    <td>a2 A sword is a bladed weapon intended for slashing or thrusting that is longer than a knife

	the historical epoch or the geographic region under consideration. The blade can be straight or curved.

<li>•Possibility to strike behind the opponent’s shield</li>
<li>•Swifter to unsheath than straight blades</li>
<li>•Provides interesting balancing opportunities</li>
